# Python-Memory-usage
A detailed presentation on how Python allocates memory for each data type, including shallow and deep memory sizes.
# How Much Memory Does Python Allocate for Each Data Type?

This repository contains a *PowerPoint presentation* that explains how Python manages memory for different data types. It is designed for Python developers, data analysts, and anyone interested in understanding Python’s memory model.

## What You Will Learn
- How CPython allocates memory for *small and large objects*
- The *internal structure* of Python objects
- Difference between *shallow and deep memory size*
- Memory usage of *basic data types* (int, float, str, etc.)
- Memory usage of *collections* like lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets

## Usage
You can *download the PowerPoint PDF* from this repository and use it as a reference to understand Python memory allocation and optimize your programs.

## License
This project is for *educational purposes*.
